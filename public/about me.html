<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Aspiring to become the best version of myself i can be through coding. Want to help my family and make them happy for what i have achieve in life. 
  I want to be able to leave a footprint onto this earth and want my kids to maintain that for me. Hardest worker in any room and strive to be the 
  best in what ever i do in life. Coding can give me the freedom that i seek and the freedom that i want in life and being able to learn that is a privelege
  and a honor making me expeditiously chase after all my goals and not be stuck in that warehouse shitty job that makes me lose my head. I want to be able 
  to live a life that is never ending wether that be traveling or making money i want my life to have purpose and action. I want no, I need to become a man of higher status 
  becuase it is what i born to be in life. Praise be to the most high.
